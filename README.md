It is specifically designed for analytics platforms that have varying access patterns, which can result in the need for complex queries. End-users who may not have the necessary technical knowledge to write such complex queries will benefit from this app as it provides an easy-to-use interface for building these complex queries. The library offers the ability to copy the query to clipboard, send the query to backend as either a string or as a Rule object array, providing flexibility for various use cases.
